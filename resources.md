# Software

The course comes with a handy [docker
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kayceesrk/cs3100_iitm) which contains the
necessary software to run OCaml, SWI-Prolog and the Jupyter notebooks, primarily
through which the course is taught. The instructions for running the Jupyter
notebooks is [here](https://github.com/kayceesrk/cs3100_m25).

## Docker

Docker is a free software and is supported
on all major platforms. The installation instructions for Docker is available
[here](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms). 

## OCaml

You don't need a local installation of OCaml on your machine for the course. The
docker image is enough. If you want to, check out
[ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org/).

## SWI-Prolog

You don't need a local installation of SWI-Prolog on your machine for the
course. The docker image is enough. If you want to, SWI-Prolog installation
instructions are [here](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html).
